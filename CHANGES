Changes with v1.0.0-230306

*) First Release
- To extract certificate information from arbitrary files, use the -> https://github.com/password123456/py_certificate_extractor. it may help you.
- If a driver (.sys) file is signed with a dual certificate (sha1, sha256 code signing), the sha256 certificate information is not scanned correctly. 
- This seems to be caused by the deprecation of sha1 certificates, which we are still checking.(We don't think this is a problem, and if it is, we will fix it).)
- these are Antivirus driver files, legitimate (healthy) drivers on the Windows system, and driver files that are certified by Microsoft and have a dual certificate (SHA1, SHA256).
